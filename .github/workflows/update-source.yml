# This GitHub Actions workflow is designed to automate the process of updating
# OVPN sources in the "sources" branch whenever there are changes pushed to the
# "main" branch. Files under drivers/net/ovpn and include/uapi/linux/ovpn.h are
# forced to be added to the commit so that they can be included in the generated
# tarball.
